chemview is the new molecular viewer for IPython notebook, in this tutorial we'll see how to plot molecular orbitals using it.

As chemview is only a visualization library, we need to use something else to produce/get the data for the molecular orbital. In this example we'll visualize water molecular orbitals extracted from a GAMESS-US calculation using the library `cclib`.

## Options to generate data

PyQuante
Orca
GAMESS
Gaussian
