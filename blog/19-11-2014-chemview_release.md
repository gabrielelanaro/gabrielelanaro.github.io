# WebGL Molecular Viewer for the IPython notebook

The python ecosystem has grown a lot in the past few years and Python has estabilished to be a fundamental tool for science and data analysis. Unfortunately some fields still lack basic tools to fully embrace the python ecosystem.

Inspired by tools such as mdtraj, mdanalysis and (my own) chemlab, I decided that it was time to bring a fully-functional molecular viewer to the browser and IPython notebook.

## Introducing chemview

chemview lets you visualize chemical systems in the browser in IPython notebook. It is completely cross platform and fairly easy to install.

   # Download chemview
   $ git clone https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/chemview
   $ cd chemview
   
   # Install dependencies
   $ pip install ipython-notebook
   
   # Install chemview
   $ pip install .

Thanks to the IPython notebook now you can visualize chemical systems along with your plots and this opens the possibility of a totally new workflow.
