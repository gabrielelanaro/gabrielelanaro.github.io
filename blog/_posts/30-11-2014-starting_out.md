title: Starting Out

Midway upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

Midway upon the journey of --our life-- my PhD
I found myself --within a forest dark-- without hope and purpose,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

And that's how I'm starting out this new career as a web developer, or whatever the world wants me to be.
