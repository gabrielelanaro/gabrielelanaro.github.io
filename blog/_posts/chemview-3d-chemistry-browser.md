title: Chemview: 3D Chemistry for IPython Notebook
---

[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is one of the most popular tools for data analysis. It basically lets your run Python scripts with an interactive notebook interface, allowing for runnable ''notebook'' that contains both text and data. I personally use it all the time for my research.

In the past month I've developed Chemview, an IPython notebook extensions that lets you display chemical system directly in the browser. This means that:

 - You don't have to switch programs to read/analyze/write your chemical data files.
 - You don't have to go through weird installation procedures. Chemview is a pure python module installable with pip, and, since it runs in the browser, it is automatically mutliplatform *and mobile enabled*.
 - You can build new way to visualize data using the convenient syntax of python. You can *create* new, more meaningful ways to display your result, so that you can find the patterns you're looking for.


.. Include a notebook tutorial

How about docs? Nice and clean at this url.
