    <p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm Gabriele, I love two things: making challenges and breaking them.</p> 
    <p>During the day I'm mostly a graduate student in Chemistry, but I
      manage to sneak in a lot of coding in that. That's why I consider
      myself also a software delveloper.</p>
