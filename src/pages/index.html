<h1>Gabriele Lanaro</h1>
<h2>Coder, Scientist, Writer</h2>
<p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm Gabriele, I love two things: making challenges and breaking them.</p> 
<p>During the day I'm mostly a graduate student in Chemistry, but I
      manage to sneak in a lot of coding in that. That's why I consider
      myself also a software delveloper.</p> 

<h2> Site under construction </h2>
<p> If you need to say me something just drop me an email </p>
