My name is Gabriele Lanaro and I currently reside in Vancouver, BC. 

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at News360. I develop and maintain machine learning applications that analyze and classify news articles. My specialty are machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. Throughout my career as a scientist and as an engineer I nurtured my passion for programming and technology. My skill-set is unique set, combining the analytical thinking of a scientist, and the technical experience of a software developer.

I developed a few open source projects that you can check on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gabrielelanaro) page. In 2013 I authored a book published by PACKT called [Python High Performance Programming](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1783288450/) where I explain the general-purpose techniques that I use to optimize my Python programs. In 2017, I wrote the new edition High Performance Python
