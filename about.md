My name is Gabriele Lanaro and I currently reside in Vancouver, BC. 

I work as a Software Engineer at Tableau Software where I work towards a new generation of tools that use statistics and machine learning to surface insights from raw data.

Previously as a Machine Learning Engineer at News360, I developed scalable machine learning services to analyze and classify news articles.

I developed a few open source projects that you can check on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gabrielelanaro) page. In 2013 I authored the first edition of the book [Python High Performance Programming](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1783288450/) where I explain the general-purpose techniques that I use to optimize my Python programs. In 2017, I wrote the second edition titled [Python High Performance](https://www.amazon.com/Python-High-Performance-high-performing-applications/dp/1787282899/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=python+high+performance&qid=1551761991&s=gateway&sr=8-1).

I also enjoy cooking, reading, hanging out in breweries and going for a walk.
