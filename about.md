My name is Gabriele Lanaro and I currently reside in Vancouver, BC. 

I'm a PhD candidate in Chemistry at the University of British Columbia. My research is about discovering how salt crystals dissolve and nucleate in water through molecular simulation. Throughout my career as a student I nurtured my passion for programming and technology and I acquired a unique set of skills, combining the rigor of science, and the flexibility of programming. After my studies I'd like to pursue a career as a Software Developer.

I develop and maintain a few open source projects that you can check on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gabrielelanaro) page. In 2013 I authored a book published by PACKT called [Python High Performance Programming](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1783288450/) where I explain the general-purpose techniques that I use to optimize my Python programs.
